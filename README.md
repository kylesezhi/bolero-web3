# Employee Recognition Awards
Web app that allows users to create, email and analyze employee awards.
## Introduction
Our project is a web application for the management and creation of employee award certificates. The application has a front end that interfaces with a database that stores information about registered users, as well information about individual awards created with the application. The application has a login and authentication system to control access. Employee award certificates are sent by email to the recipients. Data about users, regions, and awards sent can be analyzed in the Analytics section. Our application requires a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

The completed project can be accessed at the following URL:

## Usage
As mentioned above, the application supports two user types: regular users and admin users. Regular users are envisioned as managers in a company that can give awards to their employees. Admin users are envisioned as individuals responsible for administering the system, such as performing business intelligence analytics and granting access to regular users.

To login as either a regular user or an admin user for testing or evaluation purposes, go to [http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~pikec/bolero/index.php](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~pikec/bolero/index.php) and enter the following credentials into the login screen:
### Regular User
Username: user@gmail.com

Password: a
### Admin User
Username: admin@gmail.com

Password: a

If you’ve created a user account for your own email address (see below on how to create new accounts), you can also try the “I forgot my password” link on the login page. There you can enter your email address, and you will be sent a link where you can reset your password.
